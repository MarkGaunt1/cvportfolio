        <h3><b><u>Objective</u></b></h3>
        <p>After spending 20 + years working in the recruitment industry, my objective is to now change career direction and obtain a trainee/junior developer position.</p>
        <p>This has been an ambition held for many years, but only now – with the option of flexible learning via The Developer Academy’s online course/developer bootcamp – have I been able to put the wheels in motion.</p>
        <p>As detailed above, the course is delivered through both online assessments and three weekly group sessions (each three hours long) held evenings/weekends in Sheffield. Prior to signing up for this course, I had already completed some online Javascript training – but with TDA’s tutor/mentor access, I was able to take my training to the next level.</p>
        <p>The tutors/mentors at TDA are from the industry and work with some of the region’s leading tech employers (ie Sky). They are able to teach students the skills employers really need (front and back-end development using Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.JS, C#, etc).</p>
        <p>Again, my aim is to obtain a trainee/junior developer post. I appreciate I will need support and further mentorship/training, but I am able to be completely flexible re salary and engagement type (although, full-time perm is obviously the preferred option). Plus, I also bring with me extensive transferable skills covering customer service, sales/business development/account management, strategic management, finance/bookkeeping – and also, specific skills in IT recruitment/resourcing, in which, I am more than willing to offer additional/dual support to any potential employer!</p>
        <p>And finally, to give an idea re my dedication/work ethic, I have committed myself to the above training whilst still holding down a full-time post and being a father to three, very active small children!</p>
